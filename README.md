# Number-Guesser

The number guesser is a simple javascript game where a user has three lifeline and has to guess a number within a certain range of values.

If the user guesses the correct answer at any point, the game ends and the user has won. If the person doesn't get the right guess in those three trials then the game also ends and the right answer is revealed to the person.
